This project was developed during my thesis period as a requirement for my Research subject. The title of the study is "Automated Vital Signs Checker for Dialysis Patients". The system is all about checking a dialysis patients' vital signs (heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure and body temperature) in order to monitor the well being of the patient. It uses Twilio SMS API for SMS feature and has been integrated to different electronics modules for acquiring vital signs. Everything was written in Python, both the logic and the user interface.
